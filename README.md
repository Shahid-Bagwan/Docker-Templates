## Introduction

Docker is a powerful tool for containerizing applications, which allows you to bundle all the necessary components (dependencies, libraries, etc.) into a single package. This ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies the deployment process. This repository provides Dockerfile templates tailored to specific web development frameworks, making it easier for you to get started with containerization.

## Templates

Below are the available Dockerfile templates for each web development framework:

### Angular + Django

This template is suitable for projects that combine the frontend Angular framework with the backend Django framework.

### jQuery + Laravel

Use this template if you are building a project that incorporates the frontend jQuery library with the backend Laravel framework.

### React + Node

For projects that use the popular frontend library React.js along with the backend JavaScript runtime environment Node.js, this template is the one to use.

### Next.js + PostgreSQL

If you are developing an application with the Next.js framework and utilizing PostgreSQL as the database, this template will suit your needs.

### Vue.js + Spring Boot

This template is for projects that combine the frontend Vue.js framework with the backend Spring Boot framework.
